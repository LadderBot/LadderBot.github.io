Specifics on game play.

<!--more-->

---

The team at the top of the ladder at the end wins a prize.

1. **Challenge Range**: Teams may challenge anyone three ranks higher than them on the ladder. For example, rank 10 can challenge ranks: 9, 8, and 7.

2. **Mandatory Play**: If challenged, and you're not already in a ladder game, you must play. Not playing results in a forfeit and loss of position on the Ladder. Teams must play their match within a week, or it will be automatically canceled, and no rank will change.

3. **Color Assignment**: The team initiating the challenge plays as Team 1, and the challenged team plays as Team 2.

4. **Position Swapping**: If the higher-ranked team wins, or the lower-ranked team forfeits, the two teams swap positions on the Ladder. There are no draws, so teams must play until one wins.

5. **Challenge Limitation**: After a ladder game, the losing team must play a game with someone else before they can challenge the same opponent again.

6. **Ladder Order**: The initial order is determined by a random draw at the start. New teams joining later are placed at the bottom.

7. **Resolving Disputes**: In case of disputes, find a moderator.
